## Step 5: Merge your pull request

Nice work, friend :heart:! People will be reading your blog in no time!

### üìñ Theory: Merging a pull request

> [!NOTE]
> Merging a pull request means combining the changes from one branch (like `my-pages`) into another (like `main`). Learn more in the [GitHub glossary](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-glossary#merge).

Merging your pull request will publish your changes to your GitHub Pages site.

### ‚å®Ô∏è Activity: Merge your changes

1. Merge your changes from `my-pages` into `main`. If you created the pull request in step 2, just open that PR and click on **Merge pull request**. If you did not create the pull request earlier, you can do it now by following the instructions in [step 2](./2-step.md).
1. (optional) Delete the branch `my-pages`.
1. Wait about 20 seconds then refresh this page. [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) will automatically update to the next step.
