## Step 1: Enable GitHub Pages

### üìñ Theory: What is GitHub Pages?

GitHub Pages lets you turn your repository into a website. This is a great way to share your project, resume, portfolio, documentation, or even a blog with the world.

 When you enable GitHub Pages on a repository, GitHub takes the content that's on the main branch and publishes a website based on its contents.

- Turning on GitHub Pages creates a deployment of your repository. GitHub Actions may take up to a minute to respond while waiting for the deployment. Future steps will be about 20 seconds; this step is slower.
- In the **Pages** of **Settings**, the **Visit site** button will appear at the top. Click the button to see your GitHub Pages site.
